Navbar Offcanvas
================

Navbar Offcanvas is a simple off canvas navigation example using the Bootstrap 3 navbar that doesn't add unnecessary markup.

No extra `<nav>` or `<ul>` elements are added. Instead, the default `.navbar-collapse` behavior is overwritten with the `.navbar-offcanvas` class.

This was adapted from [Bootstrap's offcanvas example.](http://getbootstrap.com/examples/offcanvas/)
